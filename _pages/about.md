I am a PhD student in machine learning under the supervision of Dr [Michael Spratling](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/michael.spratling/mike/index.html) and Dr [Dimitrios Letsios](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/dimitrios.letsios/) at the Department of Informatics, Kingâ€™s College London. My PhD study is funded by [King's-China Scholarship Council PhD Scholarship](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study-legacy/funding/kings-china-scholarship-council-phd-scholarship-programme-k-csc). Prior to coming to King's, I received a MSc degree in computing with my thesis advised by Professor [Wayne Luk](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl/) from Imperial College London. I also received a B.B.M. in finance with my thesis advised by Professor [Zheng Qiao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qiaozheng) from Xiamen University.



My research interests include

* Trustworthy ML: robustness, AI safety, Alignment esp. for large multimodal models (LMMs) and LMM-based Autonomous Agents
* [Data-centric ML](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/): generative models for data augmentation, large-scale data profiling
* AI+ Applications: healthcare, robotics, finance



Collaboration: my collaborators and I are looking for new mates to join the team to develop new methods for robust large multimodal models and using generative models for data augmentation. If interested, you are more than welcome to contact me to discuss.
