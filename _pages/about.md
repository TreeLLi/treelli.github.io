I am a PhD student in computer science under the supervision of Dr [Michael Spratling](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/michael.spratling/mike/index.html) and Dr [Dimitrios Letsios](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/dimitrios.letsios/) at the Department of Informatics, Kingâ€™s College London. My PhD study is funded by [King's-China Scholarship Council PhD Scholarship](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study-legacy/funding/kings-china-scholarship-council-phd-scholarship-programme-k-csc). Prior to coming to King's, I received a MSc degree in computing with my thesis advised by Professor [Wayne Luk](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl/) from Imperial College London. I also received a B.B.A. in finance with my thesis advised by Professor [Zheng Qiao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qiaozheng) from Xiamen University.



My research interest includes adversarial robustness and interpretability of machine learning currently with a focus on the application of computer vision. The ultimate goal is to develop machine learning systems that are reliable and understandable to humans so that they can be safely deployed in our society to benefit. I am also interested in applying such techniques to other domains such as finance and healthcare.
