I am a PhD student in machine learning under the supervision of Dr [Michael Spratling](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/michael.spratling/mike/index.html) and Dr [Dimitrios Letsios](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/dimitrios.letsios/) at the Department of Informatics, Kingâ€™s College London. My PhD study is funded by [King's-China Scholarship Council PhD Scholarship](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study-legacy/funding/kings-china-scholarship-council-phd-scholarship-programme-k-csc). Prior to coming to King's, I received a MSc degree in computing with my thesis advised by Professor [Wayne Luk](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl/) from Imperial College London. I also received a B.B.A. in finance with my thesis advised by Professor [Zheng Qiao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qiaozheng) from Xiamen University.



My research interests include
